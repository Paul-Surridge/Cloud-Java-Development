Spring

	Spring Boot:

		- Spring Boot is a framework that enables the building of standalone, production-grade Spring based applications that can run easily and quickly.
		- Spring Boot does not require the configuration to be repeated for each application.
		- Spring Boot applications typically require very little Spring configuration which is mainly auto-configured.
		- Spring Boot main features include:

			1. Spring Boot starters:

				- Modules to quickly get started with commonly used technologies e.g. Spring MVC, JPA ...
				- Modules are pre-configured with the most commonly used library dependencies removing the need to manually research, find and configure compatible libraries.

			2. Spring Boot auto-configuration:

				- Auto-configuration is applied to many components automatically.
				- Auto-configuration removes the need to manually setup much boilerplate configuration e.g. if project contains spring-webmvc dependency, a DispatcherServlet is registered automatically.

			3. Spring Boot encorporates an easy to use embedded servlet container.

				- Web applications typically require creating and deploying *.war file to run within a Tomcat server.
				- Web applications can alternatively be housed within a self-contained *.jar file with an embedded servlet container.

			4. Spring Boot utilises elegant configuration management.

	Initializr:

		- Initializr in an online Spring Boot application generator used to create Spring Boot application from scratch.

	Project Structure:

		- Initializr will create a project of the following structure:

			Spring-Boot-Project:						Project root directory
				.idea
				.mvn
					wrapper
						maven-wrapper.jar
						maven-wrapper.properties
				src							Source directory for module
					main
						java
						resources				Project resources e.g. images, configuration files ...
							static				Static resources e.g. css, js, html ...
							templates			Template resources e.g. thymeleaf, groovy ...
							application.properties		
					test						Source directory for unit tests
						java
				.gitignore
				boot-demo.iml
				mvnw							Startup batch script used when running from console
				mvnw.cmd						Startup batch script used when running from console (Windows)
				pom.xaml

			External Libraries
				...

	
	Developer Tools:

		- Spring boot has many developer tools to assist in application development including:

			- Auto Update:

				- Auto update can sense when files have changed on the classpath and run an automatic restart of the application.
				- Auto update enables the quick editing of templates without the need to manually stop/start the application.

	Notes:

		- Logback.xml Rename:

			- Logback.xml should be renamed as Logback-Spring.xml when within a Spring Boot project.
			- This enables Spring to be fully in control of all aspects of the initailsiation process.

		- ANSI Console Output:

			- Within application.properties:

				# enable ansi output
				spring.output.ansi.enabled = always

			- This will cause the console output to be colour coded and easier to read.
