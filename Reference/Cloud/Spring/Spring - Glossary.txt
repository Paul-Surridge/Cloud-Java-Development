		- Layer should be considered as:

			'Service Layer':		All components associated with and providing the Service functionality of the overall application.

		- Sub-Element Types are/apper to be another name for attributes within an XML element:

			<property name="driverClassName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
