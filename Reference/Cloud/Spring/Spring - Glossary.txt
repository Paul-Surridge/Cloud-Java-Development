Glossary - Spring:

	Collaborators:

		- Beans internal references to other beans/dependencies:

			class ClassA
			{
			    ClassB B;
			    ClassC C;

		- Bean ClassA collaborates with instances of ClassB and ClassC (once injected by container).

	Client Bean:

		- Bean that is receiving a resource in the form of an injected target bean.

	Configuration Methods:

		- Setter methods used to inject dependencies into beans.

	Factory Bean:

		- A general bean which is used to instantiate other beans via static or instance factory methods.
		- A FactoryBean (opposed to just general bean) is an implementation within Spring.

	JavaBean:

		- Class with only x1 default (no-argument) constructor.
		- Class with only appropriate getter/setter for each property.
		- Many Spring developers use this form prefering 'true' JavaBeans, however Spring is not restricted to only this form of bean, non-bean style can of course be incorporated.

	Layer:

		- Layer is a common abstraction used to logically group and categorise multiple components within an application (rather than taking some physical form representing a layer).
		- Layer should be considered as:

			'Service Layer':		All components associated with and providing the Service functionality of the overall application.
			'Data Layer':			All components associated with and providing the Data storage/retrival functionality of the overall application.

	Sub-Element Types:

		- Sub-Element Types are/apper to be another name for attributes within an XML element:

			<property name="driverClassName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>

			'name' and 'value' are sub-element types within the <property/> element.

	Target Bean:

		- Bean which is to be injected into a client/receiving bean.
