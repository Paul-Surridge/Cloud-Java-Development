Permutations and Combinations:

	In general:

		Permutation:	Order matters		The order does matter in that characters which are arrange in a different order are different permutations.
		Combination:	Order not matter	The order does not matter in that the same set of characters can be arranged in different order and still be the same combination	

		Permutation:	Is the specific arangement of a characters
		Combination:	Is the specific 'make-up' of characters	

	Given ABC and CAB:

		Permutation:	2		There are x2 permutations of the same x3 letters
		Combination:	1		There is only x1 combination as ABC and CAB are ultimately the same x3 letters combined in a group

		ABC and CAB are the same combination but different permutations.

	Given a set [A B C D]:

		If considering only x2 letters out of the x4 at anyone time:

			AB	BA	CA	DA
			AC	BC	CB	DB
			AD	BD	CD	DC

		Here:

			Permutations:	12
			Combinations:	6	Given AB and BA are the same combination (but not the same permutation).

	Given a set [A B C]:

		Permutations are:

			[A B C]	[B A C] [C B A]
			[A C B]	[B C A] [C A B]

		Therefore a set of N size will have N! permutations (but only one combination).

	Total:

		Given:	n: Set Size
			R: Consideration Size

		Number of Permutations:

			Notation: nPR

				  n!
				------
				(n-R)!

			Therefore the above produces:

				  4!	= 12
				------
				(4-2)!	

			If wish to find the number of permutations of whole set then set R = n therefore (n-R)! -> 0! = 1 i.e. n! overall.

		Number of Combinations:

			Notation: nCR

				    n!
				---------
				(n-R)! R!

			Therefore the above produces:

				   4!	  = 6
				---------
				(4-2)! 2!
